Easy installation of WIN32FORTH from 1  image file

Using Virtual Box  from Oracle 

This   is a ready to go  Win32forth installation in only  1 file.  ( go --> ** here ) 

You have both versions  installed : Win32forth v. 4.0  and v6.15 no virus message, 
... it simply works ! ( * I recommend to use Win32forth Version 6.15)

An image installation is  good to get the  feeling how Win32forth performs, 
and what you can do with it. Of course do not pretend it will work as in the real Windows installation...
but the benefit is you can download on any machine  withot effort.
it will run on a Mac ,  Linux ,   Xp , Win7, 8 10 or WinXX...
and it will not  afect  anything  on your computer !
